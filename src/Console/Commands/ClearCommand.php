/**
 * FlashHALT Clear Command - Safe Cleanup and Maintenance Interface
 * 
 * This Artisan command provides comprehensive cleanup functionality for FlashHALT
 * compilation artifacts while maintaining the highest standards of safety and
 * user experience. Unlike creation commands that build new functionality, cleanup
 * commands require special consideration for potentially destructive operations.
 * 
 * The command demonstrates several key principles of safe cleanup interface design:
 * - Explicit confirmation for destructive operations with clear consequence explanation
 * - Progressive cleanup modes from cautious analysis to comprehensive removal
 * - Comprehensive feedback about what was found and what was actually removed
 * - Intelligent detection of compilation artifacts across different application states
 * - Safe file operations with proper error handling and rollback capabilities
 * 
 * The psychological aspect of cleanup commands requires different design approaches:
 * - Users are more cautious about removal than creation operations
 * - Clear communication about what will be lost and what can be regenerated
 * - Multiple confirmation points for operations with significant impact
 * - Detailed reporting about what was actually accomplished for confidence building
 * 
 * This implementation shows how to balance thoroughness with safety, providing
 * developers with powerful cleanup capabilities while maintaining confidence that
 * important work won't be accidentally destroyed.

     * The command signature balances simplicity with safety through thoughtful option design.

     * - Force flag that requires explicit intention for potentially dangerous operations
     * - Dry-run capability that allows safe exploration of what would be cleared
     * - Granular options that provide control over different types of cleanup
     * - Verbose modes that provide transparency about cleanup operations

     * - The absence of a force flag defaults to safe, non-destructive behavior
     * - Multiple confirmation points ensure developers understand consequences
     * - Granular cleanup options allow targeted maintenance without overreach
